		<h1>About</h1>
			<p>This page showcases a few different cases (games) of some ball(s) bouncing off of the screen walls. The bouncing logic is implemented with javascript and css. There is a purpose and a meaning behind ballgame.life, beyond "ball is life", but ball is life, our planet is a one giant ball bouncing around ithin the confines of it's solar gravitational path, I digress, there is still a deeper meaning.</p>
		<h1>How to Play</h1>
			<p>The rules of the game are as follows:</p>
			<p>Based on the game and difficulty level of that game that you choose, one or multiple balls will be released onto the page. Balls move faster for higher difficulty levels. Your aim is to pop (click on) all of the balls as fast as possible, taking care not to miss click too many times. Your final score depends on your completion speed and the number of missed clicks. Oh, and, as in life you may get blue balled once in a while, or black balled, that really sucks, so sorry in advance. :(</p>
